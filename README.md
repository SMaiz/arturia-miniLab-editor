This repo contains a GUI to edit Arturia's MiniLab mkII
It is in very early stage, and needs a lot more polish, but it works
You'll need python bindings for Gtk4, libadwaita and rtmidi

The code is far from perfect, I wrote this in a week-end and it started as a simple script, so it might need a big refactor (it whould be better to use classes to define a lot of elements). It's also my first Python project, so I might have done a lot of things incorrectly.
Obviously, it's open-source so if you want to use it you can, and if you fix some bug I would love to have a MR.
